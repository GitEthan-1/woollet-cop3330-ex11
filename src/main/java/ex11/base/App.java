/**
 * Exercise 11 - Currency Conversion
 * At some point, you might have to deal with currency exchange rates, and you’ll need to ensure your calculations are as precise as possible.
 *
 * Write a program that converts currency. Specifically, convert euros to U.S. dollars. Prompt for the amount of money in euros you have,
 * and prompt for the current exchange rate of the euro. Print out the new amount in U.S. dollars.
 *
 * The formula for currency conversion is derived from
 *
 * c_to / c_from = rate
 * USD / Euro = rate
 * where
 *
 * c_to is the amount in U.S. dollars.
 * c_from is the amount in euros.
 * rate is the per-unit current exchange rate from c_from to c_to.
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * How many euros are you exchanging? 81
 * What is the exchange rate? 1.3751
 * 81 euros at an exchange rate of 1.3751 is
 * 111.38 U.S. dollars.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
 * Use a single output statement.
 *
 * Challenges
 *
 * Build a dictionary of conversion rates and prompt for the countries instead of the rates.
 * Wire up your application to an external API that provides the current exchange rates.
